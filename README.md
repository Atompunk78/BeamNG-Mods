## How do I download these if I've never used Github?

### If you want all of them:
1. Press the green 'Code' button in the top right
2. Press 'Download ZIP'
3. Extract each mod from the main zip file, then put the mods in your mod folder

### If you just want one:
1. Click the name of the one you want
2. Press the small download icon in the top right, that says 'Download raw file'
3. Add the mod to your mod folder

I take (free) mod requests, so send me any you have!

As long as they're relatively simple, I'm not a professional modder ':)

### What can I mod?
- Engine changes or swaps - this will change the horsepower, sound, torque curve, etc, but nothing visual
- Engine mods - eg double the mining truck power, or make it sound like an F1 car
- Suspension changes - eg a new stiffer suspension, or more drift angle for any car
- Improved other parts - like engines with more power, radiators with better cooling, and so on
- And other stuff too

Enjoy! :)
