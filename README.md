##How do I download these if I've never used Github?

###If you want all of them:
1. Press the green 'Code' button in the top right
2. Press 'Download ZIP'
3. Extract from the main zip file, then put the mods in your mod folder

###If you just want one:
1. Click the name of the one you want
2. Press the small download icon in the top right, that says 'Download raw file'
3. Add the mod to your mod folder

I take (free) mod requests, so send me any you have! (as long as they're simple, I'm not a professional modder!)
Enjoy :)
